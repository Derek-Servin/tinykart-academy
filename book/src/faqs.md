# TinyKart FAQs

### Welcome to the FAQs! 

#### What is TinyKart?

TinyKart is a beginner-level robotics project by the Intelligent Systems Club (ISC). It’s an educational platform designed to introduce new and prospective members to robotics through an autonomous RC car. It allows members to learn and experiment in a hands-on environment before moving on to more advanced projects, like Project Phoenix.

#### How do I turn it on?

First you want to make sure that the LiPo battery is connected to the ESC and battery pack is connected to the STM board. The lights of the STM32 should be on and you should see the LiDAR's blue light spinning. Push the button on the ESC and check to see that the green light is on and flashing.

#### It's not moving...

Did you push the blue button? The blue button stops and runs the code. It is the "estop" of TinyKart.

#### It's still not moving...

Is the LiPo battery connected to the ESC? Is the ESC on? Is there something blocking the tires from moving? Is a wire out of place? Is the LiDAR not spinning?

#### The LiDAR's spinning light isn't on.

Check if a wire is disconnected. Is the board on and connected to the battery pack?

#### The STM32 Microcontroller isn't lighting up. Yes, the battery is connected to it.

The battery pack might need to be charged. Use a USB-C cable to charge it.

#### The battery pack is charged and the STM board still won't turn on.

You might be using a bad cable. Test to see if the cable doesn't work.

#### What is the LiDAR data?

The LiDAR on TinyKart is a 2D LiDAR that outputs distances in meters (by measuring the time it takes for the laser to return) all in an array. 

#### What is Ackermann steering?

It's a steering mechanism used in vehicles with two front wheels, ensuring that each wheel follows its own turning circle. This is crucial for TinyKart to mimic the steering geometry of real cars and ensures smoother and more realistic autonomous driving.

#### I want to access the TinyKart slides I was shown when I joined. Where are they?

They should be in your Google Drive > "Shared Drives" > in STUDENT-ISC Classes > TinyKart Classes. 
Go to the most recent one.

If you cannot find STUDENT-ISC Classes, and you already filled out the interest form, then let Alex or Derek know and we'll get you access.

#### What if I encounter a problem or a question that’s not listed here?
